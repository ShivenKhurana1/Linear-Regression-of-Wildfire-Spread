## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data}
fireData = FINALWildFireData
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r var}
avgtemp <- as.numeric(fireData$avg_temp)
hightemp <- fireData$`Highest temp`
precipitation <- fireData$precipitation
dewpoint <- fireData$dew_point
maxwind <- fireData$max_wind_speed
areahectare <- fireData$area_ha
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r histograms}
hist(avgtemp, 10, main= "Average Temperature")
hist(hightemp, 10, main= "Highest Temperature")
hist(precipitation, 10, main= "Precipitation")
hist(dewpoint, 10, main= "Dewpoint")
hist(maxwind, 10, main= "Maximum Wind Speed")
hist(areahectare, 10, main= "Area in Hectares")
```
Analyzation of the Histograms.
Average Temperature: The Average Temperature distribution seems not be skewed and in the bell shape, although there are some outliers from -20 to 0. Highest Temperature: The Highest Temperature distribution seems to not be skewed either and is also in a bell shape. Same for Average Temperature, there are some outliers ranging from -10 to 10. Precipitation: The Precipitation distribution is very collective in the 0.0 category, although there is/are some outliers in the 0.8 category. Dew point: The Dew point distribution is a bit skewed to the left and there are some outliers closer to the negative category. Max Wind Speed: The Max Wind Speed distribution is a bit skewed to the right and there are a couple of outliers towards left closer to 80 and 120 (Max Wind Speed is in Mph). Area in Hectares: The Area in Hectares distribution is very skewed to the right as is max reaches 200 thousand.

```{r outlier removing}
quartiles <- quantile(areahectacre, probs=c(.25, .75), na.rm = FALSE)
IQR <- IQR(areahectacre)
Lower <- quartiles[1] - 1.5*IQR

area_no_outlier <- subset(areahectacre, areahectacre > Lower & areahectacre < Upper)
avgtemp_no_outlier <- subset(avgtemp, areahectacre > Lower & areahectacre < Upper)

dewpoint_no_outlier <- subset(dewpoint, areahectacre > Lower & areahectacre < Upper)
maxwind_no_outlier <- subset(maxwind, areahectacre > Lower & areahectacre < Upper)
```

```{r pairs}

```{r model}
###fireModel = lm(log(area_no_outlier)~avgtemp_no_outlier+hightemp_no_outlier+precipitation_no_outlier+ dewpoint_no_outlier+maxwind_no_outlier, data = fireData)
###
fireModel = lm(log(area_no_outlier)~avgtemp_no_outlier+hightemp_no_outlier+dewpoint_no_outlier+maxwind_no_outlier + avgtemp_no_outlier:hightemp_no_outlier+ avgtemp_no_outlier:maxwind_no_outlier, data = fireData)

```

```{r avgtempModel}

From the summary statistics of the model, we can see that there is a t-value of -1.933, which
is compared to the t distribution, giving us a p-value of
0.054. Hence we can conclude that there is not strong enough evidence to suggest that
there is a difference in the relationship between average temperature and log area in Hectares.
```{r hightempModel}
###fireModel = lm(log(area_no_outlier)~avgtemp_no_outlier+hightemp_no_outlier+precipitation_no_outlier+ dewpoint_no_outlier+maxwind_no_outlier, data = fireData)

cookd2 = cooks.distance(fireModel)
sorted2 = sort(cookd2, decreasing = TRUE)
sf = summary(hightempModel)
sf
```
From the summary statistics of the model, we can see that there is a t-value of -2.16, which
is compared to the t distribution, giving us a p-value of
0.0314. Hence we can conclude that there is strong enough evidence to suggest that
there is a difference in the relationship between highest temperature and log area in Hectares.
```{r precipitationModel}
precipitationModel = lm(log(area_no_outlier)~precipitation_no_outlier, data = fireData)
cookd2 = cooks.distance(fireModel)
sorted2 = sort(cookd2, decreasing = TRUE)

sf
```
From the summary statistics of the model, we can see that there is a t-value of -0.447, which
is compared to the t distribution, giving us a p-value of
0.655. Hence we can conclude that there is not strong enough evidence to suggest that
there is a difference in the relationship between precipitation and log area in Hectares.
```{r dewpointModel}
###fireModel = lm(log(area_no_outlier)~avgtemp_no_outlier+hightemp_no_outlier+precipitation_no_outlier+ dewpoint_no_outlier+maxwind_no_outlier, data = fireData)

sf
```
From the summary statistics of the model, we can see that there is a t-value of 1.294, which
is compared to the t distribution, giving us a p-value of0.196. Hence we can conclude that there is not strong enough evidence to suggest that there is a difference in the relationship between dew point and log area in Hectares.
```{r MaxwindModel}
###fireModel = lm(log(area_no_outlier)~avgtemp_no_outlier+hightemp_no_outlier+precipitation_no_outlier+ dewpoint_no_outlier+maxwind_no_outlier, data = fireData)

cookd2 = cooks.distance(fireModel)
sorted2 = sort(cookd2, decreasing = TRUE)

sf
```
From the summary statistics of the model, we can see that there is a t-value of -0.737, which
is compared to the t distribution, giving us a p-value of 0.461. Hence we can conclude that there is not strong enough evidence to suggest that there is a difference in the relationship between max wind speed and log area in Hectares.
